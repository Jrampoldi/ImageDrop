# ImageDrop
ImageDrop is an application that will allow you to 
convert an image into a CMYK halftone image. The 
processing will seperate your image into 5 different 
images. Your 5 images will consist of cyan, magenta, 
yellow, key, and the 4 combined. This application
is ideal for screen printing, as it will allow you to
create 4 seperate screens that will create a whole, fully
colored image.
